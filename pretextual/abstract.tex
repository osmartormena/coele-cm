Abstract in the foreign language, prepared in accordance with ABNT NBR 6028:2021. The abstract must succinctly highlight the content of the text. The abstract must be composed of a sequence of concise sentences in a single paragraph, without enumerating topics. It is best to use the verb in the third person. It is important to avoid: symbols, contractions, and reductions, among others, that are not in current use; formulas, equations, and diagrams, among others, that are not absolutely necessary, and, when their use is essential, define them the first time they appear. The keywords must appear immediately below the summary, preceded by the expression \enquote{Keywords}, followed by a colon, separated by a semicolon, and ended by a period. They must be written with initials in lowercase letters, except for proper nouns and scientific names. Regarding their length, abstracts should be 150 to 500 words in academic works.
